##Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Louiseâ€™s play Fever get funded through Kickstarter by looking at trends with other related Kickstarters. Using htis analysis will help Louise decide when to run her campaign. 

## Analysis
The most likely it is to succeed for a campaign would be in May with a budget of 1000 to 4999. This is deducted by looking at the graphs created and looking for the highest point on the graphs on the success line.

## Challenges
A challenge I had was figureing out how to get calculated data to populate in the number successful/failed/cancled fields in the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet. I initially thought you could have a simple statement of "1000<=4999", but I was wrong and you actually need to different statemnts in the COUNTIFS calculation. 

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Two conclusions that I can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date are that the best month to launch a campain is May, and the worst month to launch a campaign is October. One could argue that the worst month would also be May, however that is if we don't first look at the percentage of successful to failed, which is for 31.9% May and 43.4% for October. 
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals a budget of 1000 to 4999 would lead to the most success for projects under the subcatergory of theater. 
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this dataset are that it does not have a list of how many tiers there was for each project. If a campaign had less tiers or more tiers would that impact the rates of successful/failed/cancled projects?
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some possible tables and/or graphs that we could create are a comparison of which countries had the most successful/failed/cancled projects.
